//! The world an invocation opens (decision 0023, phase 1): loading the
//! map, resolving its paths against the workspace, and pinning it.
//!
//! The shape and its refusals are `forge_core::realms`; this is the half
//! that touches a filesystem. A map NAMED at invocation and missing, or
//! present and malformed, is a refusal here — before a store is opened
//! and long before any seat spawns. There is no silent fallback: a world
//! that never drew a map notices nothing, and a world that drew a broken
//! one is told.
