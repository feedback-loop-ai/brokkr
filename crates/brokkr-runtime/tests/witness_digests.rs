//! The byte-identity witnesses of the agent-library slice (decision
//! 0016, spec AC-4), pinned BEFORE any production edit so the claim is
//! measured across the change rather than asserted after it.
//!
//! `recipes/fast`, `recipes/node`, `recipes/preflight` and
//! `bundles/verify` adopt no agent. Their pinned manifest digest must
//! not move, and their manifest must carry no `agents` key at all —
//! absence, not an empty object, is what keeps a non-adopting bundle's
//! identity exactly what it was.
//!
//! Adopting no agent is not the same as answering to nobody. Both seat
//! INLINE gates, and since decision 0021 a gate stands on an adapter's
//! declared tier — so both now carry a `drivers` key naming the adapter
//! digest that authorised each judging seat. That key is the witness the
//! refusals were missing: without it a demoted tier would change what
//! the compiler allows while leaving the bundle's identity untouched.
