  # the derivation fetches the same attested tarball every other channel
  # installs, so the nix store path is provably the release's bytes.
  #
  # The `sha256` values below are placeholders (sixty-four zeros) until a
  # release renders them — `bash packaging/bump-from-sums.sh` reads the
  # release's attested SHA256SUMS and the release workflow opens the pull
  # request that lands them here. `nix build` against a placeholder fails
  # loudly with nix's own hash mismatch, which is the honest failure; the
  # flake still *evaluates*, which is what `nix flake check` proves.
